Calling a server and client method must be able to return results in an
asynchronous manner.

It appears that FMS and SWF can't do this but they are included in this test so
that RTMPy can be tested properly.

1. The client connects to the server and immediately calls
   `async_server_call()`. It expects a result of 'foobar'.
2. On connection, the server immediately calls `async_client_call()` and if it
   gets the expected result back, fires another call `server_success()`.
